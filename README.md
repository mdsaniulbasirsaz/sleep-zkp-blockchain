# Sleep ZKP Blockchain Hands-On Lab

This hands-on lab demonstrates a secure and privacy-preserving Sleep ZKP Blockchain system using **IPFS, Ethereum blockchain, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**.  

The lab covers:  
- Real-time anomaly detection reports  
- AES-256 encrypted payloads  
- IPFS-based storage  
- Ethereum smart contract for immutable logging  
- ZKP hash integration for privacy validation  
- Email notifications
